## Info
My personal portfolio based on Bael template, made by [Jake 101](https://jake101.com)

Bael runs using [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org), [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org), [Netlify CMS](https://netlifycms.org), and is hosted by [Netlify](https://netlify.com). Bael requires an account with Netlify and Github/Bitbucket to deploy.
